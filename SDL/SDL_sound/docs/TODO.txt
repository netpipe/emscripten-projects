More immediate:
- Fix the crappy rewind implementation in shn.c's SHN_rewind().
- Finish implementing seek() method in decoders, see below.
- Make sure we can build shared libs on Cygwin, BeOS, Mac OS X...
- Add a buildbot

Decoders still needing seek() method:
  (If decoder can't seek, clean up the stub and report an error.)
- shn.c

General stuff TODO:
- Handle compression and other chunks in WAV files.
- Handle compression and other chunks in AIFF-C files.
- Reduce malloc() pressure.
- Maybe allow an external allocator?

Ongoing:
- look for "FIXME"s in the code.
