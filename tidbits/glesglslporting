I have found a solution in your code for my colour issue because OGLES has BGRA8888 extension... that is OK.
but still, I am not clear for 32 bit enforcement; I had already done with G:8,B8,B:8,A8 configuration for EGL config... are you saying this changes ? 

#else
   EGLint attribs[] =

   {

      EGL_RED_SIZE, 8,

      EGL_GREEN_SIZE, 8,

      EGL_BLUE_SIZE, 8,

      EGL_ALPHA_SIZE, 8,

      EGL_BUFFER_SIZE, 16,

      EGL_SURFACE_TYPE, EGL_WINDOW_BIT,

//      EGL_COLOR_BUFFER_TYPE, EGL_RGB_BUFFER,

      EGL_DEPTH_SIZE, 16,

      EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE, EGL_OPENGL_ES_BIT,

      EGL_NONE, 0

   };

#endif
   EGLConfig config;

   EGLint num_configs;

   if (!eglChooseConfig(EglDisplay, attribs, &config, 1, &num_configs))
