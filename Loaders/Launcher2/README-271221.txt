Wasm Tool Launcher - 27th December 2021
=======================================

EmJsWeb     The node.js web application - the Wasm Tool Launcher
EmLauncher  The C++ program used by EmJsWeb to launch a Wasm Tool
EmWasmTool  A Wasm Tool that converts a text string to lowercase and uppercase

The entry point of EmJsWeb is main.js through which the main page page.html and
an IFrame page toolbox.html are loaded in browser.

EmWasmTool is an example Emscripten C++ code which uses a Makefile and an
embuild.sh script to build and copy files to EmJsWeb.

EmLauncher also uses a Makefile and an embuild.sh script.  EM_ASM is used in its
code to run Javascript codes on page.html to launch the EmWasmTool with input
text as argument for the tool.

IFrame is used to separate the two web pages both use Emscripten applications.
The reason for this arrangement is that two Emscripten applications running on
the same web page may interfere with each other, causing run time errors.

In the delivered codes, two different methods have been implemented for loading
the EmWasmTool javascript codes.  In toolbox.js, there are functions of
staticLoadJs(url) and dynamicLoadJs(url, callback).  The dynamic loading which
can be activated by commenting out line 6 staticLoadJs(toolJs) in toolbox.js
causes a runtime error inside the EmWasmTool Wasm Js codes:

abort(Assertion failed: native function `stackSave` called before runtime 
initialization) at Error
    at jsStackTrace (EmWasmTool.js:1746)
    at stackTrace (EmWasmTool.js:1768)
    at abort (EmWasmTool.js:1437)
    at assert (EmWasmTool.js:656)
    at EmWasmTool.js:1502
    at ccall (EmWasmTool.js:706)
    at EmWasmTool.js:725
    at HTMLScriptElement.toolCode [as onreadystatechange] (toolbox.js:19)
    at abort (EmWasmTool.js:1443)
    at assert (EmWasmTool.js:656)
    at EmWasmTool.js:1502
    at ccall (EmWasmTool.js:706)
    at EmWasmTool.js:725
    at HTMLScriptElement.toolCode [as onreadystatechange] (toolbox.js:19)

Because of this error, the Tool's js code is statically loaded on page loading,
i.e. line 6 staticLoadJs(toolJs) in toolbox.js is not commented out.
