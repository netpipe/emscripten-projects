These are the spelling-to-phoneme pronunciation rules and exceptions lists
for each language.

You can make changes and then re-compile them to produce the "_dict"
file in the  espeak-data  data directory (eg. "en_dict") which the
speak program used.

Use:
  speak --compile=<voicename>

to compile the data for a particular language.  It automatically replaces
the corresponding _dict file in  espeak-data, ready for use by the 
speak  program.

An "_extra" file, (eg. en_extra) can be used to in addition to the "_list" file
to add exception words without disturbing the official "_list" file.
It is treated as an extension of the "_list" file.


Language Notes:

Russian.  An additional dictionary of Russian words and their stress positions
   is available at http://espeak.sourceforge.net/data/russian_data.zip.
   This allows eSpeak to put the stress on the correct syllable of Russian words.
