These files are for a version for RISC OS computers (formerly
known as "Acorn" computers), which use ARM processors.


To compile the  speakmod  module for RISC OS.

1.  Run the "copysource" script to copy the source files from the
    general  source.src  directory into the  riscos.cpp  and
    riscos.h  directories.  These already contain the RISC OS
    specific files.

2.  Run the  Makefile  to  compile and link and produce the
   "speakmod"  module.
    I used the AcornC/C++ compiler.
