eSpeak - RISCOS Version
========================

NOTE:  The contents of the files in the espeak-dat directory,
  and the format of their contents has changed for this version.
  Please delete your old  espeak-dat  directory and replace it
  with the new one in this package.


Requirements
============

RISCOS 3.6 or later with 16 bit sound system enabled.

On my 200MHz StrongArm, it takes 51 sec to process 6m 3s of speech output,
so it will probably run OK on an ARM7 processor also. 



Installation and Use
====================

1.  Copy the !eSpeak directory onto your harddrive.    

2.  To load the Speak module:  double-click on !eSpeak.
    
    This sets the <eSpeak$Dir> system variable, and then runs
    the "speakmod" file to load the Speak module.
    
    Note, <eSpeak$Dir> refers to the directory that contains the
    espeak-dat directory, which contains the speech data. It must
    be set before the module is loaded.
       

3.  Example commands:

    *help speak
      should now show version 3.30   (or whatever is the latest version)

    *speak -h
      shows the available commands
            
    *speak "this is some text"
      speaks the string "this is some text"
      
    *speak -v en-f "this is some text"
      speaks with a different voice
      
    *speak -f textfile
      speaks the text from file "textfile"
      
    *speak -a30 "this is some text"
      speaks more quietly (range 0 to 200)
      
    *speak -s200 "this is some text"
      speaks more quickly (200 words per minute)
    
    The improvement in speech quality over Speak v.2 are most clearly
    heard when listening through a good sound system (eg. domestic
    stereo system) rather than small computer speakers.
    
    
4.  Adding words to the pronunciation dictionary

    The directory "data" contains pronunciation rules and exceptions
    lists.  To add words, add the word and its pronunciation
    phonemes to en_extra and then do the speak command
   
      speak --compile=en
      
    from within the data directory.  This will recompile the files:
       en_dict  in the espeak_dat directory.
       
    Details of the phoneme codes are given in docs.phonemes/html
    
    You can see the translated phoneme codes for a word by
       speak -x "word"

    
    
Use with Pluto
==============

    !Pluto will use the new module if speakmod has already
    been run.  Pluto's Speak dialog should show the new voices.
    If you wish, you can give them more meaningful names by
    renaming the files in espeak-dat.voices
    
    To install permanently in Pluto, you can copy "speakmod" into
    !Pluto to replace the old speakmod for Speak version 2.
    
    Note that the system variable <eSpeak$dir> must be set before
    speakmod is loaded.  This can be done by either:
    
    a.  Making sure that !eSpeak is seen by the RISC OS filer
        before Pluto is run.
    or
    b.  Putting the line:
           Set eSpeak$dir <obey$dir>
        in the !Pluto.!Run file and copying the espeak-dat directory
        into !Pluto
    
    Re-select the voices that Pluto uses.  These may have changed.
    

To Re-Compile the Speak Module
==============================

    Download the "speak-*-source.zip" package and follow the instruction
    int the ReadMe file in the "riscos" directory.
    

Problems
========

1.  It uses the sound system directly rather than through the
    SharedSound module, would allow the system volume control apply
    to speech.
    
2.  There is no session management implemented, so changes to speed,
    amplitude etc by one user of the module will affect the others.
