Please help translate ISO Master into your language.

I put together a list of steps you can follow if you want to help:

  * Download isomaster.pot, the template for your .po file 
    from http://littlesvr.ca/isomaster/translations.php

  * Use your favourite po editor (I like poedit) to translate as many 
    strings as you wish. Remember that even a few words translated is 
    better than nothing. If you're not sure what something means don't 
    translate it, or you can contact me and ask.

  * Save the file as xx.po where xx is the ISO 639-1 code for the 
    language. Alternatively you can save it as xx_YY.po where YY is 
    the ISO 3166 country code.

  * Please make sure when you save the .po file that it's saved in 
    UTF-8 encoding, I'll have trouble reading them otherwise.

  * Use the contact form to send me your email address and I'll email 
    you back the same day. Sorry for the complication, I can't afford 
    to post my email address on the internet cause I'll get spammed 
    to death. 

Tip: 'image' is the ISO file; 'filesystem' is anything on your hard 
drive, but maybe on a Samba or NFS share or a USB stick, etc.

Thanks in advance.
