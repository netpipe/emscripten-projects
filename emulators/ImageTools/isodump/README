This is isodump, which extracts iso9660 images from devices or files.
In contrast to a simple cat or dd, isodump automatically detects the image
format and determines the image size from the primary descriptor block.
This way it's now possible to convert some non-iso9660 images (for instance
images generated by CloneCD) to real iso9660 images which can be mounted
via the loop device.

The usage is:  isodump [options] [file],
see the manual page for more information.

Isodump is one of some simple iso9660 utilities (named iso*), which
should be available at the biblio ftp site at
ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/disk-management/.

The file iso9660.h is taken from Eric Youngdale's mkisofs package.

There's a program isodump.c by Eric Youngdale which has nothing to do with
my program. Youngdale's program lists/extracts the __contents__ of an iso9660
image/cd.
