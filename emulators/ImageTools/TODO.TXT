ui:
- drop-down list to select track - can do multitrack
- check out thunar translators
- translate .desktop file

bk:
- dos doesn't like names to start with underscores
- add path tables, boot record to size estimate
- need a bk_set_warning_foo()
- fedora7 dvd takes forever to remangle. try either fix the algorithm or allow longer 9660 names.
- sorting 9660/joliet can also be slow
- why never checking the return from seekset?
- images to support:
 - bin/cue
 - multitrack mdf
 - uif


tests to run before a release:
- open iso from command-line
- create blank, see if it mounts (try norock, nojoliet)
- make a bootable windows (also add, delete some files)
 - see if it mounts (try norock, nojoliet)
 - see if it boots
- edit a linux disk and save without rock, without joliet, without any
- make a dos bootable cd, see if it boots
 - from scratch
 - starting with an existing no emulation bootable disk
- delete config file, make sure it still works
- add a bunch of files to an iso, delete all the files, add some more, save
- edit some text and binary files, make sure they extract and write properly
- add a 3 gig file, make sure image saves and can extract it afterwords
- make an iso with some 3G files in it, open it, save it, make sure the files are not corrupted

to make a fedora package:
- install rpmdevtools (via yum)
- fedora-buildrpmtree (as *your* user)
- Check if there is a file ~/.rpmmacros (if not create it).
- Make sure there is a line:
 - %dist   .fc7
- Download my SRPMS [1] to ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS
- Call: rpmbuild --rebuild isomaster-1.0-1.src.rpm
- Wait a moment and look for a built RPM in ~/rpmbuild/RPMS/i386

to package a release:
- cd po && ./updateall.sh
- cp sr\@latin.po sr\@Latn.po
- update VERSION in the makefile
- update version in man page
- remove -g and -DDEBUG from Makefile and bk/Makefile
- update changelog.txt
- update credits and credits.txt
- check readme.txt
- build bkisofs-manual
