/**
 Cartridge class for new tiling engine "Boulder Dash" format games with RAM.
 Kind of a combination of 3F and 3E, with better switchability.
 B.Watson's Cart3E was used as a template for building this implementation.

 The destination bank (0-3) is held in the top bits of the value written to
 $3E (for RAM switching) or $3F (for ROM switching). The low 6 bits give
 the actual bank number (0-63) corresponding to 512 byte blocks for RAM and
 1024 byte blocks for ROM. The maximum size is therefore 32K RAM and 64K ROM.

 D7D6         indicate the bank number (0-3)
 D5D4D3D2D1D0 indicate the actual # (0-63) from the image/ram

 ROM:

 Note: in descriptions $F000 is equivalent to $1000 -- that is, we only deal
 with the low 13 bits of addressing. Stella code uses $1000, I'm used to $F000
 So, mask with top bits clear :) when reading this document.

 In this scheme, the 4K address space is broken into four 1K ROM segments.
 living at 0x1000, 0x1400, 0x1800, 0x1C00 (or, same thing, 0xF000... etc.),
 and four 512 byte RAM segments, living at 0x1000, 0x1200, 0x1400, 0x1600
 with write-mirrors +0x800 of these.  The last 1K ROM ($FC00-$FFFF) segment
 in the 6502 address space (ie: $1C00-$1FFF) is initialised to point to the
 FIRST 1K of the ROM image, so the reset vectors must be placed at the
 end of the first 1K in the ROM image. Note, this is DIFFERENT to 3E which
 switches in the UPPER bank and this bank is fixed.  This allows variable sized
 ROM without having to detect size. First bank (0) in ROM is the default fixed
 bank mapped to $FC00.

 The system requires the reset vectors to be valid on a reset, so either the
 hardware first switches in the first bank, or the programmer must ensure
 that the reset vector is present in ALL ROM banks which might be switched
 into the last bank area.  Currently the latter (programmer onus) is required,
 but it would be nice for the cartridge hardware to auto-switch on reset.

 ROM switching (write of block+bank number to $3F) D7D6 upper 2 bits of bank #
 indicates the destination segment (0-3, corresponding to $F000, $F400, $F800,
 $FC00), and lower 6 bits indicate the 1K bank to switch in.  Can handle 64
 x 1K ROM banks (64K total).

 D7 D6 D5D4D3D2D1D0
 0  0	  x x x x x x		switch a 1K ROM bank xxxxx to $F000
 0  1					        switch a 1K ROM bank xxxxx to $F400
 1  0					        switch a 1K ROM bank xxxxx to $F800
 1  1					        switch a 1K ROM bank xxxxx to $FC00

 RAM switching (write of segment+bank number to $3E) with D7D6 upper 2 bits of
 bank # indicates the destination RAM segment (0-3, corresponding to $F000,
 $F200, $F400, $F600). Note that this allows contiguous 2K of RAM to be
 configured by setting 4 consecutive RAM segments each 512 bytes with
 consecutive addresses.  However, as the write address of RAM is +0x800, this
 invalidates ROM access as described below.

 can handle 64 x 512 byte RAM banks (32K total)

 D7 D6 D5D4D3D2D1D0
 0  0   x x x x x x		switch a 512 byte RAM bank xxxxx to $F000 with write @ $F800
 0  1					        switch a 512 byte RAM bank xxxxx to $F200 with write @ $FA00
 1  0					        switch a 512 byte RAM bank xxxxx to $F400 with write @ $FC00
 1  1					        switch a 512 byte RAM bank xxxxx to $F600 with write @ $FE00

 It is possible to switch multiple RAM banks and ROM banks together

 For example,
 F000-F1FF   RAM bank A (512 byte READ)
 F200-F3FF   high 512 bytes of ROM bank previously loaded at F000
 F400        ROM bank 0 (1K)
 F800        RAM bank A (512 byte WRITE)
 FA00-FBFF   high 512 bytes of ROM bank previously loaded at F400
 FC00        ROM bank 1

 This example shows 512 bytes of RAM, and 2 1K ROM banks and two 512 byte ROM
 bank halves.

 Switching RAM blocks (D7D6 of $3E) partially invalidates ROM blocks, as below...

 RAM block    Invalidates ROM block
 0        0 (lower half), 2 (lower half)
 1        0 (upper half), 2 (upper half)
 2        1 (lower half), 3 (upper half)
 3        1 (upper half), 3 (lower half)

 For example, RAM block 1 uses address $F200-$F3FF and $FA00-$FBFF
 ROM block 0 uses address $F000-$F3FF, and ROM block 2 uses address $F800-$FBFF
 Switching in RAM block 1 makes F200-F3FF ROM inaccessible, however F000-F1FF is
 still readable.  So, care must be paid.

 This crazy RAM layout is useful as it allows contiguous RAM to be switched in,
 up to 2K in one sequentially accessible block. This means you CAN have 2K of
 consecutive RAM (don't forget to copy your reset vectors!)
