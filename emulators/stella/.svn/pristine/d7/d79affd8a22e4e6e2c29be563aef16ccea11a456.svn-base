/**
  This class implements a thin wrapper around the SDL keysym enumerations,
  such that SDL-specific code doesn't have to go into the internal parts of
  the codebase.  The keycodes are exactly the same, but from the POV of the
  rest of the code, they are *KBD* (keyboard) keys, not *SDL* keys.

  Once the codebase is ported to SDL2, the intent is to simply change this
  file without having to modify all other classes that use StellaKey.
