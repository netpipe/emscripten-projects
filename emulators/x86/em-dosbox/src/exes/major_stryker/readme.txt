Major Stryker Freeware Release Notes - March 2006
Major Stryker is (c)1993/2006 Apogee Software, Ltd.
--------------------------------------------------

This game was deleted from Apogee's product line quite some time ago, and has been re-released as freeware in March of 2006.  As the original game programmer still works for us 13 years later, it was easy to find him and ask about a freeware release - this was released in conjunction with his entry in our "Legacy Interview Series".  There are a few notes you should be aware of with the release.

1) We offer no support in helping to getting this freeware release running.  YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN HERE.

2) This game was released before Windows 2000 & Windows XP were released, and as such, these more modern operating systems might have issues in running the game.  A third party program called DOSBox has been known to have been helpful in getting the game running.  You can obtain DOSBox here: http://dosbox.sourceforge.net

3) This game is released as freeware.  That's not to be confused with public domain, abandonware (which is illegal), or releasing something under the GPL.   This is a freeware release, which means we retain full legal rights to the title and it's materials.  You are free to play the game as we've released it, but not free to "do whatever you want with it", which includes selling it or otherwise using the materials in other projects.

That's about it - before we go, we'd like to leave you with a few thoughts on Major Stryker by both Allen Blum (the game's original project leader) and Joe Siegler (original beta tester for Stryker)

Enjoy Major Stryker!

When Major Stryker was released was a big change in my life. I just moved to hot, flat Dallas Texas from the sunny beach town of Santa Cruz, California to finish work on Stryker and start working on Duke Nukem II. It was fun being here to see all the things that went on getting Stryker out such as Flyers and CDs being made. But wow that first summer here and the 100 degree heat was painful for me..

Major Stryker is a milestone game for me.  When I became involved with the company originally, it was as a beta tester in the post Wolfenstein 3D craze of 1992.  The games in testing then were Math Rescue and Major Stryker.  I remember the first beta build we ever got of Stryker - it was darn near impossible!  I remember every tester complaining about how hard it was.  But it was fun.  I rather enjoyed it, as I liked that type of game, so I enjoyed testing it.

When I got hired on with Apogee, the first new game release after I started was Major Stryker, and was the first thing I ever "released" in my (then) new job of Online Support.  It was my duty to release games to BBS's at the time (Software Creations, Exec-PC, and about 20-30 more around the country).  In 2006 it's easy - put it on the web, and it's everywhere almost immediately.  But back in January of 1993 when this was originally released, things were different.  I'd easily spend a whole day or two releasing around the country.  

I remember Major Stryker's release well.  It was a big moment in my professional life, and I'm glad we can bring the game back for those who wanted to play it again, but couldn't because of it being discontinued for years.
