# EDIT THIS BEFORE USING !
#
# this is an example commandline parameter file for LOADLIN
# You may have comments starting with "#" at any place
# comments end at end of a line
# any number of empty lines may be inserted.
# The contents are compacted by LOADLIN to produce an as small
# commandline as possible.
# For more commandline options see the file PARAMS.DOC.
#
# There can only be one parameter file and LOADLIN must be called as:
#   LOADLIN @param_file
# However, the parameters in param_file may be overwritten by
# (or appended to) those following the @param_file, e.g:
#   LOADLIN @param_file image=other_image root=/dev/other
#
#
..\zImage          # first value must be the filename of the Linux-kernel
                   # if this should be changed at load time,
                   # the keyword 'image=' must be used (see above)

#-v              # verbose the actual params, but load anyway
-t             # write debug output and stop.
#-d c:\dump     # write debug output to file c:\dump and stop.

                # vga=has changed, to get the actual values for your
                # special video card, you should use 'ask' and remember
