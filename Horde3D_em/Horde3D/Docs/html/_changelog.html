	<li>Modification: Root node has no more value 0 but is defined as constant with value 1.</li>
	<li>Modification: Joints and meshes can be hierarchical now.</li>
	<li>Modification: LOD is only available for Group nodes.</li>
	<li>Added projective texture parameter for Light nodes.</li>
	<li>Implemented getting and setting of joint transformation for procedural animation.</li>
	<li>Added animation blending and mixing.</li>
	<li>Implemented animation for objects without skin.</li>
	<li>Implemented inter-frame interpolation for animations.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Version [0.8.0]</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Added API getter-functions for most setter-functions.</li>
    <li>Added API function to access resource data and node data. This makes it it possible to read out geometry data and use it for collision detection or physics.</li>
    <li>Added API function to update resource data (implemented for 2D texture images).</li>
    <li>Added API function to iterate over child nodes.</li>
    <li>Added API function to get node type.</li>
    <li>Added FOV for spot lights.</li>
    <li>Changed coordinate systems to be right-handed for better compatibility with other libraries and tools.</li>
    <li>Changed XML attributes for node position in SceneGraphResource from x, y, z to px, py, pz.</li>
    <li>Added obligatory scene node attributes for Mesh containing the vertex range of the batch.</li>
    <li>Modification: Layer of overlays can be negative meaning that they are drawn as underlays before scene objects are rendered.</li>
    <li>Modification: Joints are part of the scene graph now.</li>
    <li>Modification: Scene graph files don't need to have a Group as root any more, instead any scene node type can be used as root.</li>
    <li>Modified shadow mapping implementation to make use of PCF. The blurring of the shadow term texture in a post-processing step has been removed resulting in much better performance.</li>
    <li>Removed ShadowMapSoft option from scene node parameters.</li>
    <li>Improved skinning implementation. Skinned vertices are in world space now instead of bone space.</li>
    <li>Modified geometry resource format to be compatible with new skinning implementation and to use less memory.</li>
    <li>Made many other smaller bugfixes and improvements in engine core.</li>
    <li>Added utility function to create texture resource data from raw image data.</li>
    <li>Added utility function to free memory allocated by the utility library.</li>
    <li>Changed command line arguments of Collada tool.</li>
    <li>Extended Collada tool to handle assets with several skin modifiers.</li>
    <li>Made other smaller improvements to Collada tool.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version [0.7.0]</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Added new API function for setting morph target weights.</li>
	<li>Changed geometry resource format to include morph data.</li>
	<li>Added loading, interpolation and rendering of morph targets to engine core.</li>
	<li>Changed initial model node bounding box calculation to respect initial skinning pose.</li>
	<li>Added parsing and export of morph targets to Collada tool.</li>
    <li>Made other smaller improvements to Collada tool.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version [0.6.1]</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed problems with shadows on older ATI hardware by unrolling for-loops in the blur shaders.</li>
	<li>Reduced joint maximum from 60 to 59 to avoid shader register overflows; this will have to be improved in upcoming versions.</li>
	<li>Added cube map support for materials.</li>
    <li>Updated normal calculation for Collada tool to be more robust.</li>
    <li>Made other smaller improvements to Collada tool.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version [0.6.0]</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Introduced shader context concept.</li>
    <li>Integrated basic shadow mapping implementation with screen-space blurring.</li>
    <li>Added blending for lighting pass so that more than one light source can be used now.</li>
    <li>Added alpha blending for overlays.</li>
    <li>Made smaller bug fixes and code improvements in the engine core.</li>
    <li>Updated Chicago sample to demonstrate shadow mapping.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Version [0.5.1]</h2>
<ul>
