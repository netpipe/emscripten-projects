\page doc_adv_precompile Pre-compiled byte code

Sometimes it may be useful to use pre-compiled bytecode instead of re-building the 
scripts every time a script is loaded. This can for example reduce load times, or 
if scripts are transferred over the net, it can reduce the transfer time for large scripts.

To save already compiled code you should call the \ref asIScriptModule::SaveByteCode "SaveByteCode" 
method on the \ref asIScriptModule, passing in a pointer to the object that implements the \ref
asIBinaryStream interface. The script module will then push all the bytecode and related data onto
this object with the \ref asIBinaryStream::Write "Write" method.

When loading the pre-compiled bytecode you should first get an instance of the \ref asIScriptModule,
just as if compiling a new script. Instead of calling AddScriptSection followed by Build you will
call the \ref asIScriptModule::LoadByteCode "LoadByteCode" method, passing it a pointer to the binary 
stream object. The script module will then pull all the bytecode and related data from that object with 
the \ref asIBinaryStream::Read "Read" method to reconstruct the script module.

\section doc_adv_precompile_1 Things to remember

 - The engine configuration must be the same when saving and loading the bytecode, otherwise the 
   load will fail as functions, types, or global properties cannot be found.
   
 - The script engine doesn't perform validation of the pre-compiled bytecode, so the application is
   responsible for authenticating the source. If this authentication isn't performed by the application
   you'll have potential security risks in your application as the bytecode may have been manually 
   manipulated to perform otherwise illegal tasks.
   
 - The pre-compiled bytecode is currently not independent of the used CPU architecture, a script that
   is compiled for a 32-bit target is generally not equal to a script compiled for a 64-bit target. This 
   is also true for big-endian and little-endian differences. The bytecode is independent of the target 
   OS though, so a script compiled on Linux is equal to Windows, given that the engine configuration is
   the same for both.
